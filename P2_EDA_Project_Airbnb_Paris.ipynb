    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "When traveling to Europe and booking an Airbnb rental property for a vacation, I try to spend less on lodging to be able to afford good dining and tours.  For Paris specifically, I find that the options close to the centre, that is close to the top attractions i.e. Eiffel tower, Champs Elysees are pricier, and most of the properties are unavailable as well, so I end up staying further from the centre, and when I do, I am always worried that I might have booked a property that is way too far out from the centre of the city, and or far from a metro station -- since actual location is not provided until after you have made the reservation, or unless you contact host and ask.  Distance to the station is relative depending on how far one is willing to walk, but for me, more than half a mile walk to a station is considered far, since I feel I have to save all my energy for the leisurely walking one does around in Paris.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions for Exploration / Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1) to be able to explore and answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How does location influence property rental price, reviews and availability?  What are the options for being able to stay close to the centre for budget of less than \\$100?\n",
    "\n",
    "* What other features drive the price of an airbnb rental property?\n",
    "\n",
    "  i.e. price vs location, price vs distance from a top attraction, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) recommend Airbnb properties given a certain criteria, and enable a more informed decision for the traveler: \n",
    "\n",
    "* walking distance to one of the top attractions (within 2 miles)\n",
    "* walking distance to metro station (within 1 mile)\n",
    "* rating >= 9\n",
    "\n",
    "* other user defined criteria i.e. \n",
    "* number of beds\n",
    "* number of bedrooms\n",

    "The geojson file format was read and used for this analysis. The original download file has eighty-six (86) columns, columns which are not needed for analysis, i.e. calendar_last_scraped, calendar_updated, listing_url, etc. were dropped to minimize columns and focus on cleaning and analysis of data which will be useful this EDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'city' column was dropped from the file as well, since all the records downloaded are those pertaining to Airbnb rental properties in Paris, France.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further research on zipcodes was done, and found that zipcodes 75001 - 75020 correspond to Arrondissements 1 through 20 in Paris.  Since analysis will be focused on properties within the centre of Paris, the records with zipcodes outside of this range were deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "*More information on Paris Arrondissements in wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrondissements_of_Paris\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing Values:\n",
    "Missing values in beds and bedrooms were imputed using the following rules:\n",
    "* If 'beds' has a missing value, and 'bedrooms' has a valid value, 'beds' is set with the value of 'bedrooms'.\n",
    "* If both 'bedrooms' and 'beds' are missing, both fields are set to 1, which is the average number of beds and bedrooms,\n",
    "and it would be safe to assume that if a property is being rented out in Airbnb, that there is at least one bed, and we will count that as one bedroom, regardless if the property is a studio apartment, where there is no pyhsical division between the rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were several records as well with missing 'scores' value, a new column 'rating_ind' was created to flag rated = 1, versus unrated = 0 records, so further analysis can be done between these two populations.  The record was flagged as rated, if all the score values have been populated, and set to unrated, if at least one of the score values has not been populated."
