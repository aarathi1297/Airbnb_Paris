    "### Problem Narrative:\n",
    "When traveling to Paris and booking Airbnb for a vacation, I try to spend less on lodging to be able to afford good dining and tours.  I find that the options close to the centre, that is close to the top attractions i.e. Eiffel tower, Champs Elysees are pricier, and most of the properties are unavailable as well, so I end up staying further from the centre, and when I do, I am always worried that I might have booked a property that is way too far out from the centre of the city, and or far from a metro station -- since actual location is not provided until after you have made the reservation, or unless you contact host and ask.  Distance to the station is relative depending on how far one is willing to walk, but for me, more than a mile to a station is considered far, since I feel I have to save all my energy for the leisurely walking one does around Paris.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) to be able to explore and answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How does location influence property rental price and reviews?  What are the options for being able to stay close to the centre?\n",
    "\n",
    "* What other features drive the price of an airbnb rental property?\n",
    "\n",
    "  i.e. price vs location, price vs distance from a top attraction, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) recommend Airbnb properties given a certain criteria, and enable a more informed decision for the traveler: TBD\n",
    "\n",
    "* walking distance to one of the top attractions (within 2 miles)\n",
    "* walking distance to metro station (within 1 mile)\n",
    "* rating >= 9\n",
    "\n",
    "* other user defined criteria i.e. \n",
    "* number of beds\n",
    "* number of bedrooms\n",
    "* price range\n",
    "* type of property"
