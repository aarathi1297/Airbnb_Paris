    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "When traveling to Europe and booking an Airbnb rental property for a vacation, I try to spend less on lodging to be able to afford good dining and tours.  For Paris specifically, I find that the options close to the centre, that is close to the top attractions i.e. Eiffel tower, Champs Elysees are pricier, and most of the properties are unavailable as well, so I end up staying further from the centre, and when I do, I am always worried that I might have booked a property that is way too far out from the centre of the city, and or far from a metro station -- since actual location is not provided until after you have made the reservation, or unless you contact host and ask.  Distance to the station is relative depending on how far one is willing to walk, but for me, more than a mile to a station is considered far, since I feel I have to save all my energy for the leisurely walking one does around Paris.\n",

    "## Questions for Exploration / Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1) to be able to explore and answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How does location influence property rental price, reviews and availability?  What are the options for being able to stay close to the centre for budget of less than \\$100?\n",
    "\n",
    "* What other features drive the price of an airbnb rental property?\n",
    "\n",
    "  i.e. price vs location, price vs distance from a top attraction, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) recommend Airbnb properties given a certain criteria, and enable a more informed decision for the traveler: \n",
    "\n",
    "* walking distance to one of the top attractions (within 2 miles)\n",
    "* walking distance to metro station (within 1 mile)\n",
    "* rating >= 9\n",
    "\n",
    "* other user defined criteria i.e. \n",
    "* number of beds\n",
    "* number of bedrooms\n",
    "* price range\n",
    "* type of property"

We can see that there are some outliers -- properties over \\$400, causing a huge difference between the mean and the median price, and for the distribution to be right skewed."

We can add another feature for an indicator if property is within two miles of one of the top attractions, and the top attraction it is closest to and use that for further analysis, instead of the individual distances to the top attraction.\n",
